A simple zombie game for RGTI project.
Game is written in java using OpenGL LWJGL.
Everybody is invited to make commits and features of their own :).

Story:
You are a captain with his own crew and ship and are summoned to city that needs your help. Your mission is to save the
city of infection, because the fat politicians are afraid, that the quarantine won't hold and will be forced to level
the city to the ground. You say so what? What about possible survivors? There's where you come in as a captain,
that is willing to risk the life of himself and the crew to save the inhabitants of city Lego.

But everything is not as simple as it sounds. All the rich gentlemen are not going to risk their lives and money for
 anybody and will open the quarantine under one condition. No more than a hundred infected may pass us. Less then that the quarantine defence will be able to hold and kill, more they will not risk. If the event of out failure the city will be blown up with us inside.

Weapons on board
Because we want to protect and save the city, we are limit to simple weapons that are behind our time. The city is build with plastic blocks and can't stand any kind of heat. The city council has armed us with self-inflating steel balls, that we can throw into the infected. Will you be able to save the city from infected with available weapons and prevent the destruction of this beautiful city?
